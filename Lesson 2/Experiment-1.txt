//Hello! we are continue lesson2.
//Fun fect ""volatile"" is a master in code hehe...
//if ARM Complier is a version 6, THAT mean unnecessary code going to
//put it out.
//WHY? like wait command are sometimes not usefull and complier version 6
//not add the code them
//but if we need the them we could use "volatile int ..." 
//and there is no problem at all
//or you could just use version 5

#include "Board_LED.h"			//:Board Support:LED

int main(void)
{
	volatile int i;
	LED_Initialize();
	
	while(1)			//for ever loop
	{					
		LED_On(0);
		for(i=0;i<1000000;i++);
		LED_Off(0);
		for(i=0;i<1000000;i++);
	}
